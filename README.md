### Notes on Cloudinary

Integrated cloudinary with the following integration

1. Gatsby Transformer Cloudinary Plugin [Applied]

- Image is still hosted in local cdn / git, it will be uploaded during build time to cloudinary (removing the need for gatsby-trasnformer-sharp & gastby-plugin-sharp) potentially reducing build time in converting that image
- Netlify CMS setting should still be set as normal with standard Media Folder location.

2. Netlify CMS with Cloudinary Media Library

- Change _ALL_ image upload to Cloudinary it will be exported back as URL to cloudinary
- Image transformation can be applied through URL setting in Clouinary [https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations]

#### OTHER NOTES

- Netlify Large Media Clashes with Gatsby Build Transformers will only work if using Images as is
- NetlifyCMS is useless with Gatsby Cloud as it always deploy preview. Pottenntially Gatsby Cloud is good with other CMS like Strapi as it build preview.
